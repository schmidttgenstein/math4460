    ### Step 0: load data 
    data_path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)),'data','pa0_train.csv')
    data =  pd.read_csv(data_path,index_col = False)  #load_data_function

    ## a train/test split (but you certainly can if you'd like!)
    x,y =  np.array(data.iloc[:,:-1]), np.array(data.iloc[:,-1])
            # separate input data from labels and convert to numpy arrays

    ### Step 2:  train model 
    ## will need to define .fit() method of FirstClassModel
    # Calling this method will fit parameters of your model
    fcm.fit(x,y)

    
    ### Step 3: define prediction methods
    ## one should give the probability associated to class 1, and
    # the other the discrete class predictions
    y_probs = fcm.predict_probabilities(x)
    y_pred = fcm.predict_class(x)

    # printing for debugging purposes, not needed 
    print(y_probs)

    ### Step 4: define metrics method
    ## evaluate performance
    metrics = fcm.performance_metrics(x,y)
